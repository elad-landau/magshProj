This project is the final project of the Magshimim program. It is a chat application called "Ahlan". The project was done in pairs. Here we published an incomplete version of the project. The software is divided into two main parts: one, the client side, running on Android, and the second, the server side, running on a Windows computer. The project demonstrates a large-scale project, working with Git, network programming, Android, Java, and databases
